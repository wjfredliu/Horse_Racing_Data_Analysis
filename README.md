# Horse_Racing_Data_Analysis

I initially got interested in looking at horse race betting through a behavioral economics lens. According to research on human behavior, people tend to make riskier bets later in the race day to try and recover from any losses throughout the day. Since horse odds shift with betting behavior, the “riskier” horses don’t have as good of a payout once everyone starts betting on them, so it’s actually more advantageous to go against the grain and bet on low risk horses at the end of the day. With this background, I became interested in analyzing what makes a horse more likely to win, whether that be its race odds, country of origin, or position around the track. I got the data from Kraggle on thoroughbred racing in Hong Kong.

In this data analysis I will answer the following questions:
*Q1: How does winning percentage/average finishing ranking vary by hourse country? How have these metrics changed over time?  
Q2: How does positioning throughout sections of the race correlate to the final outcome? Do positions stay relatively constant throughout the race?  
Q3: How accurate are the win odds to determine the outcome?  
Q4: Which jockeys consistently perform well regardless of the odds set against them
